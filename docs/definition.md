### Goals
Wat wilde je bereiken in deze fase?    
Welke deelvragen moesten hiervoor beantwoord worden?

In this phase, we focused on understanding how young children (ages 2–5) recognize, interpret, and respond to emotions when these are conveyed through simple visual and auditory cues. We aim to determine which forms of expression, colors, and interactions are the most intuitive for this age group. These insights are essential for identifying which sensory elements—such as light, sound, movement, or haptic feedback—Wobble can best use to accurately reflect emotions and effectively support children in self-regulation.

#### Research questions
* How do children associate colors with emotions?
* Which colors do they perceive as calming, exciting, or cheerful?
* How do children interpret minimalist faces?
* Which variations (eyes, eyebrows, shape) make emotions most clear?
* How do children behave toward a non-living character that displays emotions?
* Which sensory feedback is most effective in eliciting empathy, recognition, or comforting behavior?
* Does this behavior vary between age groups or between boys and girls?

Leg uit en toon welke prototypes gemaakt werden en hoe deze helpen om de onderzoeksvragen te beantwoorden (benoemen wat je aftoetst & link naar design requirements).

Om deze vragen te beantwoorden, werd gewerkt met low- en mid-fidelity prototypes die elk één specifiek onderdeel van het ontwerp toetsten.

| Prototype                     | Goal                                   | assessment                                                      |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **30+ cards with facial expressions**       | Understand how childeren recognise emotions and categorise them | readability of facial expressions, intensity, preference for variants |
| **teddy bear / pillow / figure on box** | Observation from natural social behavior | Comfort behaviour, personification, distance/approximation, usage behaviour |
| **Color cards**             | Researching emotional color associations | Positive/negative feelings, recognition, putting it on an emotion scale |


#### Test 1. Facial Expressions
Goal : investigating which facial expressions and emotions are perceived as connected by children between the ages of 2 and 5, and which expressions we should use in the design of Wobble.

Children get to look at more than 30 variations of facial expressions.
* Ages 4–5: children are expected to create their own categories and label them with emotions.
* Ages 2–3: are given predefined categories (happy, angry, scared, sad).
Afterwards, they use dot voting to choose which variant in each category they like the most or least. This provides insights into the readability of the eyes, the role of eyebrows, the extent to which minimalist faces are sufficiently expressive, and which facial expressions are preferred.

#### Test 2. Interaction Test
Goal : Determine which sensory features Wobble should use to elicit natural and meaningful interactions.


A prototype character is introduced and placed in a brief scenario (sadness, fear, anger, joy). The children’s initial reactions are carefully observed and coded, such as:
* Comforting behavior (hugging, petting, holding);
* Talking to the object or asking questions;
* Uncertainty, keeping distance, or fearful behavior;
* Laughing or indifference;
* Functional use of the object.
We compare these reactions by age group and gender, and also examine whether children personified the object (giving it a name, talking to it as if it were alive).

#### Test 3. Colortest
Goal: Determine which colors Wobble should use for its emotional light signals.

For each color, the children go through the same steps:
* Naming associations;
* Indicating the feeling (positive/negative);
* Placing it on an emoji-emotion scale.
This clarifies which colors feel calming, exciting, or overwhelming to children.


### Results
Rapporteer over de resultaten (incl. foto's, quotes, analyseframeworks, ...)

The group from the second kindergarten class created many more categories than the groups from the first class and appeared to influence each other quickly. Overall, four of Ekman’s six basic emotions spontaneously emerged during the card-sorting activity with the facial expressions. Many children had difficulty categorizing certain facial expressions, which sometimes resulted in cards being placed in seemingly random categories. Nevertheless, the grouping of similar facial expressions generally reflected which emotions were recognizable to the children. Preferences for favorite and least favorite facial expressions were highly individual, and the votes did not exhibit any clear patterns.




### Conclusions & implications
Definieer de belangrijkste designbeslissingen.

Children can quickly name a few basic emotions. As they grow older, they learn to recognize more emotions. Recognizing emotions based on eyes alone is difficult, whereas emotions involving eyebrows are recognized more quickly. Therefore, it is essential that Wobble has both eyes and eyebrows, so that children can accurately identify the emotions, especially when the expressions are combined with a color in a specific context.
Following guidelines were defined based on the card sorting activity:
| Facial expression                     | Guidelines                                   | 
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Fear**       | Large eyes with raised eyebrows |
| **Sadness** | Curved eyebrows angled towards the eyes |
| **Sleeping Wobble**             | Lines to represent closed eyes, with "zzz" written on the side |
| **Confusion**             | Lack of eye contact, achieved by having Wobble look around |

When Wobble is happy, we will give him a neutral facial expression that has not appeared in the conclusions for the other emotions listed above.
When Wobble is angry, we will use low eyebrows slanting inward.
The children will be able to identify Wobble's emotion based on the context and color.
