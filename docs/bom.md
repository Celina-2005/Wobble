## Bill of materials

| Function | Components/Materials (low-budget) | Complexity | Priority |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Haptic interaction (hugging, touch) | Pressure sensors (FSR), capacitive touch sensors, soft filling (foam/fiberfill), fleece or stretch fabric, optional vibration motor | Low–medium | Very high |
| Visual feedback – facial expressions | Small LED matrix or simple LCD/OLED screen, microcontroller (Arduino / ESP32) | Medium | High |
| Auditory feedback (response sounds) | Small speaker, buzzer, sound module (DFPlayer Mini), microSD card | Low | Medium |
| Color as visual cue | RGB LEDs or LED strip | Low | Low |
| Housing (functional) | 3D-printed housing or foam/cardboard structure, textile cover | Low | Low |


#### Justification for Priority

The prioritization is based on the results of the children's tests and the goal of creating a functional and testable prototype in the next semester. Haptic interaction has the highest priority because children spontaneously soothe themselves through touch when experiencing negative emotions. Visual feedback through facial expressions follows, as this proved to be clearer and more meaningful than color alone. Auditory feedback serves as a supporting modality and is technically accessible. Color and casing are considered secondary and serve primarily to enhance attention and experience, rather than as a primary communication layer.
